            Olympiad Level Prep
        </h3>
        <p>As we go through the AP physics ciriculum, we simulatenously explore olympiad level questions to help people get registered and prepare for the f=ma exam. The board will help solve and questions or queries members might have!
        </p>
        <h3>Labs and Demonstrations:</h3>
        <p>To help understand the content, we explain concepts using easy-to-understand demonstrations so that our members can see the application of the material in real life. We also periodically conduct labs through which everyone is engaged and can participate succesfully.</p>
        <h3>Test Review:</h3>
        <p>For all the students currently taking AP Physics C or another physics course, we review and practice circulum content to make sure that members are enjoying and succeeding in their means of learning the subject.</p>
